# ☁️ AWS Hands-On Practice

This section of my DevOps journey is dedicated to learning and practicing **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**. It includes real configurations, command-line usage, and documented learnings while working with AWS services.

## 🎯 Goal

To build strong, practical experience with core AWS services that are essential for DevOps, automation, and infrastructure management.

## ✅ What I'm Doing Here

- Creating and managing **IAM users**, groups, and policies
- Launching and accessing **EC2 instances**
- Practicing with **S3 buckets** and object storage
- Using **AWS CLI** for resource management
- Preparing for infrastructure automation (Terraform, CloudFormation in future)
- Following best practices around **security**, **access control**, and **resource management**

---

## 🧠 Why AWS?

- Most widely used cloud provider in DevOps and enterprise environments
- Deep integration with CI/CD, monitoring, and IaC tools
- In-demand skill for Cloud & DevOps roles

## 🔧 Tools Used

- AWS Console
- AWS CLI
- IAM, EC2, S3, CloudWatch (initial focus)
- Bash, JSON
- Visual documentation (screenshots, README)

---

## 🚀 What's Next?
