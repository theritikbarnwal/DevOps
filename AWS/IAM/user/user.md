# üîê AWS IAM User Creation & Permissions Setup

This repository documents the **first step** of my AWS journey ‚Äî creating a secure IAM user with the appropriate permissions for AWS CLI and console access.

---

## üìå Objective

Establish a non-root IAM user for administrative and DevOps tasks, following AWS best practices for security and access control.

---

## üßæ Summary

- ‚úÖ Created an IAM user: `ritik`
- ‚úÖ Attached necessary permissions via inline and managed policies
- ‚úÖ Configured AWS CLI locally using programmatic access
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MFA not yet enabled (next step for hardening access)

---

## üìÅ Steps Performed

### 1. üîê Created IAM User

- Username: `ritik`
- Access types:
  - ‚òëÔ∏è Programmatic access (for CLI use)
  - ‚òëÔ∏è AWS Management Console access

---

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è Assigned Permissions

IAM user added to group: **`DevOpsAdmin`**  
Attached policies:
- ‚úÖ `AdministratorAccess` (inline policy)
- ‚úÖ `AmazonEC2FullAccess` (AWS managed)
- ‚úÖ `AmazonS3FullAccess` (AWS managed)

> This provides full access to EC2 and S3 services, along with admin capabilities for learning and testing.

---

### 3. ‚öôÔ∏è AWS CLI Setup

Configured AWS CLI using:

```bash
aws configure
````

Then verified:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws iam list-users
```
