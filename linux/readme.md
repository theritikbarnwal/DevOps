# 🐧 Linux Journey - Phase 1 (DevOps)

This repository marks the beginning of my DevOps journey, starting with Linux. Here's what this phase includes:

* 🔧 Hands-on practice with essential Linux commands
* 🖥️ Shell scripting for automation
* 📁 Working with files, directories, and permissions
* 📜 Logging and command history tracking
* 💡 Building a strong foundation for DevOps tools and practices

Each day, I'll be uploading new tasks, challenges, and tools as I continue learning and building confidence with Linux.
